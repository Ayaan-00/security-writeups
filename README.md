# Security Writeups

This repo documents how I think about offensive security. Not just what I found or what tools I used, but why each finding matters and how it connects to real business risk.

Most of this work was done over the past year across my master's program, co-op placements, and independent study. I was focused on doing the work, not publishing it. Now that I'm moving into the job market, I'm putting it all in one place so the methodology and thinking behind what I've done is actually visible.

The writeups range from authorized assessments on live client systems to simulated penetration tests and structured lab exercises. They're ordered below by the type of engagement, not by when I did them.

**Confidentiality note:** All client work is fully anonymized. No organization names, URLs, infrastructure details, or other identifying information is included anywhere in this repo. Confidentiality is the foundation of security work, and I treat it that way.
